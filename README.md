# Pimped Radio

What is it?
-----------
This project will create an internet radio player to be used in your computer (PC, Linux, Mac).
It is called Pimped Radio because this internet radio player will:
* Look cool, displaying the album art of the song that is playing.
* Support different streaming formats.
The points mentioned before are the ones that will be shipped in Version 1.0

Technologies to be used
-----------------------
* Java 8
* JUnit/Hamcrest [Testing]
* Amazon [Find CoverArt and Album]
* JVLC [The actual music player]

Future
-------
Improvements and new features that will be developed on following versions that currently I have on mind are:
* Support to control through a mobile device.
* Add extra information about the song played, like artist, link to buy the album, video play in YouTube of the current song, maybe lyrics display too.
